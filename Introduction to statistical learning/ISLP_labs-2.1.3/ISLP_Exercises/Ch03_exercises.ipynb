    "- In terms of sales, we can see that TV and radio share a lot in common when it comes to the budjet to sales ratio. As for newspapers, the sales are significantly lower when it comes to the budget used for advertising. This should lead to the sales manager rethinking the budget for newspaper sales and focus more on TV and Radio sales."

    "- Based on these p-values, we can conclude that sales are significantly and positively influenced by advertising budgets for TV and radio. In contrast, the newspaper advertising budget does not have a statistically significant effect on sales. Therefore, if a company wants to allocate its advertising budget effectively to increase sales, investing in TV and radio would be statistically supported strategies, whereas investing in newspaper advertising might not be as effective."
