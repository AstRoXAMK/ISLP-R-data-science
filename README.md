# My personal progress in the book Introduction to statistical learning

 I was introduced to this book via this YouTube video . I was working on Helsinki University MOOC-course "Data Analysis with Python", which I will work on along side this book. I found this book by sheer coincidence

This book was created by 5 different professors from 3 different universities in the USA. Most notably 3 professors from Stamford University, Prof. Trevor Hastie, Prof. Rob Tibshirani and Prof. Jonathan Taylor all of whom are professors of Statistics. Other co-authors are Prof. Gareth James of Emory University, Goizueta Business School and Prof. Daniela Witten of the University of Washington also professor of Statistics. 

Quote from the website:
"As the scale and scope of data collection continue to increase across virtually all fields, statistical learning has become a critical toolkit for anyone who wishes to understand data. An Introduction to Statistical Learning provides a broad and less technical treatment of key topics in statistical learning. This book is appropriate for anyone who wishes to use contemporary tools for data analysis.

The first edition of this book, with applications in R (ISLR), was released in 2013. A 2nd Edition of ISLR was published in 2021. It has been translated into Chinese, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Mongolian, Russian, and Vietnamese. The Python edition (ISLP) was published in 2023.
